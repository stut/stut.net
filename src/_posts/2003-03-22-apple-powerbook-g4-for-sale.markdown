 Painful though it is it has to go. I'm not using it as a laptop - it tends to just sit on my desk at home most of the time. I can get a much faster desktop machine for the money I'll get from selling it so that's what has to be done.

I've put it up on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/" target="_blank">eBay</a> today with a 7 day duration. Bid for it here: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3408489922" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3408489922</a>
