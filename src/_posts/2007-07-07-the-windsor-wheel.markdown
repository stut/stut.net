There's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_wheel">ferris wheel</a> up in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=sl41rh&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.4845,-0.611973&amp;spn=0.002679,0.007167&amp;t=k&amp;z=18&amp;om=1">a park next to the Thames</a> in Windsor at the moment. It's pretty big and apparently feels quite unstable at the top - I haven't been on it, not my sort of thing at all.

Earlier this week we had a very patchy day weather-wise and I decided to take advantage of the strange effect this has where the sky is very overcast but there is clearly a bright sun behind you.
