As I <a href="http://stut.net/blog/2007/11/10/web-hosting-a-mugs-game/" title="Web Hosting - A Mugs Game">mentioned in my previous post</a> there were other reasons as to why I have decided to shut <a href="http://sharedserver.net/" title="SharedServer.net: Drop dead hosting">SharedServer.net</a> down, but I couldn't say what they are. Well, I can now.

I have been recognised. Not in the "Oh look, it's that Stut fellow" sort of way, but for my professional contributions to the world of online classified advertising. I've been promoted to <strong>Head of Technology</strong> at <a href="http://www.freeads.co.uk/" title="Freeads.co.uk - the fastest growing independant online classifieds website">Freeads Classifieds</a> - sounds grand doesn't it! After thinking about it for a bit I decided I can't realistically be in such a position <em>and</em> have outside interests that take a fair portion of my time and attention. That coupled with the reasons I gave in my previous post led me to the inescapable conclusion that I eventually reached.

There are two positive side-effects coming out of these happenings. The first is that I'm looking for PHP developers. I'll post more details when I've written up job specs, but current plans mean I'm after either one or two junior developers with exceptional potential to join me and the rest of the team in Windsor to take the online classified market by storm. We're using <a href="http://www.php.net/" title="PHP">OOP-tastic PHP5</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" title="MySQL">MySQL</a> to power a site that currently attracts over one million unique visitors a month and rising. If you're at all interested based on that very brief description feel free to drop me an email (stuartd at freeads·co·uk) with the usual guff people want when you apply for a job and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

The second positive side-effect is that I'm gonna have a bit more spare time (at least that's part of the plan if I ever stop working all hours). This means I'll be able to work on some of the ideas that have been floating aimlessly around my head for the past few years. This is great because 1) there's no time-based targets on them, and 2) if I get bored I can stop and/or do something else instead. Progress is unlikely to be rapid, but messing around with new ideas is what I like doing more than anything else related to programming, so it's gonna be fun. And you never know, the next <a href="http://www.digg.com/" title="Digg">Digg</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> could be lurking in my brain somewhere just itching for an opportunity to escape.

So that's where I am. I hope it adequately answers the many emails I got asking why I was abandoning them, and if it doesn't please feel free to use the comments to vent!
