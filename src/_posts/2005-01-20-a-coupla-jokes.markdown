<blockquote>This bloke walks into a public toilet where he finds two cubicles, one of which is already occupied. He enters the vacant stall, closes the door, drops his trousers and sits down.A voice then comes from the cubicle next to him "Hello mate, how`s it going?"

Thinking this a bit strange but not wanting to be rude the chap replies "Yeh, not too bad thanks."

After a short pause, he hears the voice again "So, what are you up to then mate?"

Again, answering reluctantly, and unsure what to say, he replies "Amm, just having a quick poo. How about yourself?"

He then hears the voice for the 3rd time... "Listen mate I'm sorry, I'll have to call you back, I've got some madman in the next cubicle answering all my questions!"</blockquote>
<blockquote>A young boy went up to his father and asked him, "Dad, what is the difference between potentially and realistically?"

The father thought for a moment, then answered, "Go ask your mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars.
Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars, and then ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars.
Come back and tell me what you learn from that."

So the boy went to his mother and asked, "Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?"

The mother replied, "Of course I would! We could really use that money to fix up the house and send you kids to a great University!"

The boy then went to his sister and asked, "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"

The girl replied, "Oh my God! I LOVE Brad Pitt! I would sleep with him in a heartbeat, are you nuts?!?!?"

The boy then went to his brother and asked, "Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?"

Of course," the brother replied. "Do you know how much a million could buy?"

The boy pondered the answers for a few days, then went back to his dad.

His father asked him, "Did you find out the difference between potentially and realistically?"

The boy replied, "Yes, Sir. Potentially, you and I are sitting on three million dollars, but Realistically we're living with two sluts and a queer!!</blockquote>
