Microsoft has come out with a utility called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=69ba779b-bae9-4243-b9d6-63e62b4bcd2e&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Port Reporter</a>. Very similar to <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/tcpview.shtml" target="_blank">tcpview</a> from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/" target="_blank">SysInternals</a> but it does run as a service and have an associated <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/8/8/28810043-0e21-4004-89a3-2f477a74186f/PRParser.exe" target="_blank">parser</a>. I haven't played with it much yet but at first glance it appears to be exactly what I've been looking for.

I may post more about it when I have had a proper look.
