 I remember seeing this a while ago and found it very frustrating. I just <a href="http://stumbleupon.com/">stumbled upon</a> it and performed rather better. Have a go.

My record so far is <strike>about 400m</strike> <strike>625m</strike> 1401m (I really should be doing some work!!), at which point I always miss the ceiling blocks and end up hitting the spikes!!
