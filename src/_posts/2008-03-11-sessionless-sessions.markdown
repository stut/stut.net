A little while ago I mentioned in a post on the PHP-General mailing list that I'd implemented a way to persist data between page requests without requiring server-side storage. This raised a number of questions which I answered without giving too much away.

A few weeks later <a href="http://iamjochem.com/" title="The website of Jochem Maas">Jochem Maas</a> <a href="http://marc.info/?l=php-general&amp;m=120463909026488&amp;w=2" title="maintaining [user] state without a session">asked for a more detailed explanation</a>. I had already started writing an article for this site explaining the details but since it's a low priority I hadn't finished it yet. I have now.

<a href="http://stut.net/2008/07/26/sessionless-sessions-2/" title="Sessionless Sessions">Sessionless Sessions</a> is a somewhat confusing title but I hope I've explained what I mean clearly within the article As always comments are welcome.
