I've recently been transferring a lot of my sites and server-based services over to <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/2148-0-3-13.html">RackspaceCloud</a>, and part of this meant uploading a fairly large number of files to the CloudFiles service. The web interface sucks for more than a few files so I knocked up <a href="https://github.com/3ft9/CloudFiles-Uploader">this quick script</a> to make it easier. It has already saved me a ton of time so I thought it worth sharing.
