 I've created an <a href="http://stut.deviantart.com/">account at DeviantArt</a> in an attempt to get my photos to a wider audience and to get some feedback. So far so good, but I've still got a lot of old photos to sort through and decide which to submit. Already had one person add "<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7244026/">Moonlit Moment</a>" as a favourite - the first of many I hope.
