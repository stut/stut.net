<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/" title="How to Change the World - Guy Kawasaki's Blog">Guy Kawasaki</a> gave an excellent keynote at the recent <a href="http://emsummit.eventmarketer.com/" title="Experimental Marketing Summit 2007">Experimental Marketing Summit</a> where he spoke about the Art of Innovation. Yesterday he posted <a href="http://www.zentation.com/artofinnovation" title="The Art of Innovation - Guy Kawasaki">a link to the speech</a> on <a href="http://zentation.com/" title="Zentation - where video and PowerPoint meet on the web">Zentation</a> - an innovative new site that synchronises video with PowerPoint slides.

Among the points Guy makes in the speech, he advises that you "don't let the bozos grind you down", using examples such as IBM's attitude to personal computers and Western Union's opinion of the telephone. For me this is the most important point made. No matter who tells you <em>it won't work</em>, or <em>there's no market for it</em>, you need to believe that you're right and they're wrong or you'll never get anywhere.

Predicting the future is impossible, creating the future is not! Now, go create.
