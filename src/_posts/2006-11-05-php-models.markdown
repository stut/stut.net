Ok, so I was asked by someone on the PHP-General mailing list to share some code I've written and have been using for a while now. I decided it was worthy of an article, and I needed to kick start my article writing anyway. And now, after several weeks coming it's done.

The code in question is an ActiveRecord-ish implementation of a database table abstraction class.

Hopefully after you've read the article that description will make more sense.

You can find the article here: <a href="http://stut.net/articles/php_models.html">http://stut.net/articles/php_models.html</a>.

Since this is my first article I would appreciate some feedback, not only on the content but also on the general style and quality. All comments, good and bad, are welcomed.

Happy reading.

PS: The article was delayed by a couple of hours due to me wisely investing some time into <a href="http://stut.net/blog/2006/11/05/pendulumeca/">Pendulumeca</a>, and significantly improving on my previous best. My current best now stands as 2142m. Lovely.
