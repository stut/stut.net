Weird one. For some reason today Wordpress decided to develop some parse errors. Not sure what happened, but I've installed a fresh copy with no plugins or themes (hence the lovely default design).

It's kinda pointless me doing the work to get it back to where it was since I have some pretty big changes to my site in the pipeline, so for now this will do.
