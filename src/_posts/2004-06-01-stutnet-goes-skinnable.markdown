In response to a request from Jared I have added a CSS switcher to Stut.net (see bottom of navigation). If you want to create a design for Stut.net feel free to <a href="mailto:stut@stut.net">email me your CSS file</a> and if I like it I'll add it to the list.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/alternate/">ALA</a> for teaching me all about alternative stylesheets. Much better than round-tripping the server to change the style.
