Stut.net has been rewritten with a new site design (although I'm not sure I like it yet) and a new back end. The back end uses a framework called Artichoke which I've been developing for a few years now. It's currently in use here and on two sites I look after for my employer. It works well but is missing a number of features. I will be releasing it under the GPL when I feel it's ready for critical acclaim!!

In the meantime comments on the new site are welcome at <a href="mailto:stut@stut.net?subject=New%20website">stut@stut.net</a>.
