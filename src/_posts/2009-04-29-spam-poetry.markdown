<div>I'll take the position</div>
<div>assume the missionary part
you work by committee
you had me pegged from the start.
I'll be pounce pony
phony maroney
pony before the cart.
I'll be pounce pony.
this ceremony
only fills my heart.</div>
<div>

who cast the final stone?
who threw the crushing blow?
someone has to take the fall
why not me?

a punch toy volunteer
a weakling on its knee.
is all you want to hear
and all you want to see.
romantically, you'd martyr me
and miss this story's point
it is my strength, my destiny
this is the role that I have chosen.
