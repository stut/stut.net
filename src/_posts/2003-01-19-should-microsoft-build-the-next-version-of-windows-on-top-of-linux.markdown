 I saw <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030116.html" target="_blank">this article</a> posted on <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/19/0246211" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> and it made me cringe. Yes, Mr. Cringley made me cringe!! Read the article and tell me if you think he knows what he's talking about. I draw your attention to this quote as a prime example: "Even today, you can still get to a C: prompt under Windows XP, which means a disk operating system is hiding there no matter what Microsoft wants us to believe". Need I say more?!!
