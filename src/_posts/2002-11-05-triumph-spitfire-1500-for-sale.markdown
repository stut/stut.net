Yup, the time has come to say goodbye. I bought my Spitfire around July this year and have spent over £1200 getting it done up. It's cost too much money and I need some cash to put into my company so unfortunately it has to go.

It's a red 1978 Triumph Spitfire 1500 with overdrive. I have a spare hood, a hard top and various other spares. It's great fun to drive and I'm sorry to see it go, but unfortunately it has to.

The car was valued by the <a href="http://www.tssc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Triumph Sports Six Club</a> at £2,000 prior to the work being done, so I am looking for £2,250 ono.

When I get myself organised I will put more details up here along with pictures before and after the work that I've had done. In the meantime, if you're interested you can contact me by emailing <a href="mailto:stut%20at%20stut.net">stut @ stut.net</a>.
