 For those who don't know I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes 3 months ago. Since then I have changed my diet, been exercising regularly and attempting to figure out what I need to do to control my blood sugar levels.

It's now 3 months on and it was time for the blood test to get the 3 month average. I had that last Monday and the results are in. My 3 month average is 7 - this is at the upper end of what's acceptable, but it means that I don't need to go onto any drugs (would have been tablets initially). Suffice to say I'm quite happy about this and would dearly love to go out and celebrate, but I'm no longer allowed to do most of the things I usually do to celebrate :(.
