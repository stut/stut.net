The <a href="http://www.itv.com/" title="ITV">ITV website</a> has a video player on their home page. When I first visited it I got a message about it not supporting Firefox yet - question one has to be why haven't we gone past this situation yet?

However, a more interesting message appeared when I tried again with IE. The message reads...
<blockquote>Security patch required to watch video:

For our video to play, we need to install a small update to your web browser. Click on the yellow bar between the toolbar controls and the top of this page and follow the install instructions. When installation is complete, click the "run update" button that will appear below.</blockquote>
Seems reasonable doesn't it? Sounds like they're doing an excellent job protecting their users from security risks?

The yellow bar, as always, provides a description of the component the page wants you to install...
<blockquote>This website wants to install the following add-on: 'mf' from 'Microsoft Corporation'.</blockquote>
So I Google it. The only reference to a product called 'mf' from Microsoft is <a href="http://www.windowsfordevices.com/news/NS8917151086.html" title="Article on the .NET MF">an article on WindowsForDevices.com about the .NET Micro Framework</a>. While this is an interesting development I'd hardly call it a security update.

In my opinion if it's a component required for playing video on their site they should not be calling it a security update. So, is ITV misleading their users, or is there a security patch from Microsoft that is referred to as 'mf' that I've not been able to find a reference for?
