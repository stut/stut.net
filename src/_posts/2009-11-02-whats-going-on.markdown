I know it's been a while since posted anything on this blog, but I've had a lot going on and it hasn't really been at the forefront of my mind. So, what's been going on?

Firstly <a href="http://twitapps.com/">I've shut TwitApps.com down</a>. I won't go into the reasons because they're well documented in <a href="http://3ft9.com/10-twitapps-shutting-down">the blog post announcing it</a>. I've also <a href="http://3ft9.com/17-twitapps-code-released">released the code</a> so anyone can make a clone if they feel so inspired. One big side effect of this is that I'm open to offers for that domain name and a bunch of others I don't see myself using anymore. Please only contact me with serious offers.

Secondly I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately, and one of the results of that has been my <a href="http://tastingtheacorn.com/">new blog over at tastingtheacorn.com</a> where I'm writing for my benefit rather than as a service to others, which is how I view this site. Check it out and let me know what you think.

Finally I have been all over the place in terms of my career lately, which I've <a href="http://tastingtheacorn.com/my-new-plan">written about on my new blog</a> so I won't repeat it here. Ultimately it means I'm on the lookout for interesting projects to get involved with. If you think I may be able to help you or your company please let me know.

Hopefully that explains where I've been. I plan to continue publishing tech and development posts on this site for the foreseeable future, but how often depends on how much my focus gets split in my new reality. I also plan to change the layout of this site - it's starting to depress me because I never really finished it.
