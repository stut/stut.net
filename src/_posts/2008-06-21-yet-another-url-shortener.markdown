<p>I wrote this a while ago for a different domain name but didn't register it in time. I found the code a few days ago and have just finished putting the finishing touches on it. Nothing special, just a URL shortener with a base length of just 14 characters and a minimum ID length of 1.</p>

<p>For those who care... it's written in PHP, uses MySQL for storage but the destinations are cached at runtime for efficiency.</p>
