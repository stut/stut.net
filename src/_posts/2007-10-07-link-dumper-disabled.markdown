I've disabled the link dumper from <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="Delicious - social bookmarking">del.icio.us</a>. It's a great feature but my other posts are getting lost. I'll be putting together a new site for links but until I do you can see <a href="http://del.icio.us/stuartdallas" title="my del.icio.us">my bookmarks on my del.icio.us page</a>.
