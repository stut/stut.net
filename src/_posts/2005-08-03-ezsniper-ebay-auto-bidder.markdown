This rocks. Saw it a while ago and have used it a couple of times to win some auctions. Basically you log in with your eBay username and password and you get 3 free snipes to play with. You tell it the item ID you want to 'snipe' and the amount you want to bid. It then sits there being idle until 5 seconds before the end of the auction when it places your bid.

I recommend it to anyone buying on eBay - it's not missed one for me yet.
