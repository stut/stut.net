While I was on <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> I also came across this video of a roller coaster made out of <a href="http://www.knex.com/">Knex</a>. My sister has some <a href="http://www.knex.com/">Knex</a>, but I've never seen her come up with something as excellent as this. Shocking really.
