My blog entries are like buses, you wait weeks for one and two arrive at once.

My latest pet project is GRankT. GRankT is a simple website that will track the position of a URL within the top 50 search results on Google for any given search query. It's <strong>free</strong> and hopefully simple to use.

See <a href="http://grankt.sharedserver.net/">http://grankt.sharedserver.net/</a> for more information.

The core functionality is there now, that being the basic website and the daily rank updates. To come is historic displays, almost certainly in some whizzy graphy-type form. Stay tuned.
