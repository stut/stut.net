I had a request recently to release some of the code from the TwitApps bots. The core of both bots is actually a shared email handler and I have no problem sharing it with the world.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/projects/twitter/">Twitter-related stuff</a> &raquo; <a href="/projects/twitter/email_notifications.html">Handling email notifications</a></p>

On the assumption that I'll eventually get around to sharing some more Twitter-related stuff I've created a new section in the projects area of this site. If there's anything related to Twitter integration that you'd like to see me cover there please let me know and I'll be happy to help.
