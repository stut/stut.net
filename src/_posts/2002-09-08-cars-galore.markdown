For those who don't know me, I get through a fair number of cars. At present I own 2...
<ul>
	<li><strong>A Volvo 340GL, 1989 (F), Gold</strong>
Currently very dead. Doesn't have any life in it whatsoever. This is mainly due to the fact that I haven't used it for quite some time. I'm waiting for the DVLA to pull their fingers out of their arses and send me a registration document so I can arrange to scrap it. I've sent them 3 forms and as yet have had no response. Here's hoping for a miracle.</li>
	<li><strong>A Triumph Spitfire 1500, 1978 (S), Burnt Orange (red really!)</strong>
This car has just been delivered to a guy called Paul Cull for repair. He's a Triumph specialist and is booked up for 18 months. He's taken the car in on the basis that he will do bits and pieces here and there. This works well for me since the summer is over and a little sports car is not ideal for the winter months.</li>
</ul>
As you can probably deduce this leaves me without a car for the foreseeable future. So, yesterday (Sunday) I went to look at a car. A nice car. A Toyota MR2 GT T-bar 2.0 Turbo. A penis extension.

What can I say about this car? It shifts... in frightening ways. 200bhp - raw power. It was manufactured in 1990 and imported into the UK in 2000. It's dark green, has a few problems but nothing major. It's a private seller to whom I've given a 500 quid deposit pending an AA inspection. I arranged that inspection today and it should happen on Wednesday. I can happily say that I'm excited ;o)

More will be posted as the excitement unfolds!
