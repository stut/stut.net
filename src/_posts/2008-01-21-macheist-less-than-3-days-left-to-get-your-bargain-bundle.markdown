When I first came across the <a href="https://www.macheist.com/buy/invite/92105" title="MacHeist Bundle">MacHeist Bundle</a> offer I though it was too good to be true. The fact is that it's a fantastic bargain. For the grand total of $49 you get 14 software packages that would normally cost just short of a whopping $500. If you're only after two or three of them it still represents a massive saving.

I bought it primarily for <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/" title="Snapz Pro X">Snapz Pro</a> but since checking out the rest of the bundle I've realised it's much more of a bargain than I though it was. If you have a Mac I strongly recommend you check it out soon as it's a time-limited offer. Since I bought it they've added a few more packages making it even more of a bargain. These include a game, <a href="http://freeverse.com/games/game/?id=3010" title="Wingnuts2">WingNuts2</a>, of which I've been playing the demo for a while now. It'll be nice to get to the next level!

Once you've bought it you get an invite URL, here's mine: <a href="https://www.macheist.com/buy/invite/92105" title="MacHeist Software Bundle">https://www.macheist.com/buy/invite/92105</a>. If you get two people to buy the bundle through that link you unlock licenses for two extra packages, <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" title="LaunchBar">LaunchBar</a> and <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/store/index.php?main_page=notebook&amp;sub=organize" title="Circus Ponies Notebook">Notebook</a>. If you're going to buy it I'd appreciate it if you could use that URL. Thanks.

<strong>Update 22/01/08:</strong> Thanks to everyone who bought the bundle through the URL in the post - I now have both referral packages unlocked. And if you haven’t looked at <a href="http://www.circusponies.com/store/index.php?main_page=notebook&amp;sub=organize" title="Circus Ponies Notebook">Notebook</a> you should. It’s a great little app, well-worth the asking price.
