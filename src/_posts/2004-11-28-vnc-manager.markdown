I've spent most of today working on a utility called <a href="http://farsoft.com/vncmanager/">VNC Manager</a>. It's designed to make using VNC on large networks easier.

Since this is the first release I've made it has not been tested very much so I'm sure it has a few bugs and I'd appreciate any feedback people have.

The major feature it's still missing is a way to configure the auto scanning feature. It has the ability to scan one or more netblocks periodically to find new hosts but I'm yet to create a configuration dialog for it. If you want to use this feature <a href="mailto:stuart@farsoft.com">drop me an email</a> and I'll let you know the syntax for the configuration file.

And adding that page to <a href="http://farsoft.com/">farsoft.com</a> has made me realise it needs a redesign - looks awful at the moment!!
