A new phishing attack against <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has surfaced recently using the domain fbaction.net. Whenever I see these things I always reset my browser and try signing in with fake details to see what happens. In this case I got a nice surprise. When I got redirected to Facebook I got this...

<div style="text-align:center;"><a title="Facebook gets something right by Stuart Dallas, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/3486344611/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3486344611_f924e7c1d7_o.png" alt="Facebook gets something right" width="647" height="263" /></a></div>

This is fantastic. Every site should do this. It's a really simple check to do and immediately informs the user that they have probably been compromised complete with advice as to what they should do next.

Top marks to Facebook!
