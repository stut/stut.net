It would appear that Verizon doesn't know the difference between 0.002 cents and 0.002 dollars. This phonecall is extremely scary. Repeat after me... cents * number = cents. If you believe Verizon... cents * number = dollars.

The most frightening comment has to be from the 'manager'... "I've never heard of .002 dollars".

If BT were doing this it would be on Watchdog before you could say 'dunce'.

Update: The guys blog is here: <a href="http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/">http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/</a>. Looks like he got a full refund from Verizon. The blog also points to the <a href="http://media.putfile.com/Verizon-Bad-Math">full recording</a>, which is 1 hour 34 minutes long! This guy stayed amazingly calm given the circumstances.
