Occasionally the <a href="http://php.net/mailing-lists.php">PHP-General mailing list</a> encounters questions that really ought to have been asked elsewhere. Yesterday was one such occasion.

The question...

<blockquote>Hi

I know these is PHP mail list but also most active group i know is these :)
the Q is How to compile Delphi from source code in bothe linux or windows ?

My one word reply to this was "Speechless". The response I got back had me chuckling for a while after I read it, so I posted it back to the list...

<blockquote>OK, I guess I should apologise to the OP in advance, but I just had to
share this response...
