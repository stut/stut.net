As you may have noticed from my last post, I am now a Flickr user. I was using the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/stuttle" title="Stuttle's Web Albums">Google Picasa Web Album</a> service, mainly because I use <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" title="Download Picasa">Picasa</a> to manage my photo's. I wasn't using it a lot and I don't really know why. I have a large number of photo's I'd like to publish in a more organised and semantic way than my current arrangements, and recently <a href="http://blog.assembleron.com/" title="Nick Halstead">Nick</a> convinced me to check out <a href="http://flickr.com/" title="If you don't use Flickr, check it out!">Flickr</a> again.

The Flickr interface is really impressive. The organise feature in particular makes managing photo collections a breeze. I'd recommend it to everyone - it even beats some offline software I've used.

It's also great value for money. For $48 you get 2 years unlimited storage, unlimited uploads and you get to browse Flickr without ads. That's a total bargain in my book!
