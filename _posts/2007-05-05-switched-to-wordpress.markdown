Yup, it's true, I've changed my blog again! After many many years of trying I've finally accepted that I will always have far better things to do with my time than developing a blogging system, especially when there are so many high-quality options available.

Based on several recommendations I've decided to go with Wordpress. It seems to be the most mature and best supported system around. I also decided to move it to <a href="http://stut.net/blog/" title="Stut.net Blog">http://stut.net/blog/</a>, mainly because I have plans for <a href="http://stut.net/" title="Stut.net">http://stut.net/</a> and want to keep the blog separate, but more on that later.

An unfortunate side-effect of this change is that all comments have been lost. Wordpress provides an excellent RSS import feature that allowed me to import the existing entries, but no way to import the comments.

Once I had the existing entries imported I set about finding a theme I liked, and settled on <a href="http://www.roytanck.com/2006/10/27/wordpress-theme-tranquility/" title="Tranquility Wordpress Theme by Roy Tanck">Tranquility</a> by <a href="http://www.roytanck.com/" title="Roy Tanck">Roy Tanck</a>. It's clean, functional and lightweight. Not too sure about the colour scheme, but that's easily changed if it starts to annoy me. I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to use this template for the main <a href="http://stut.net/" title="Stut.net">Stut.net</a> site, but that's kinda my plan at the moment.

If you subscribe to the RSS feed please update your reader with the new URL (near the bottom of the right column). As with previous changes the old location is currently redirected, but that won't be in place for ever. You may notice that I'm now using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/" title="Feedburner">Feedburner</a> for both the main RSS feed and the comments feed.
