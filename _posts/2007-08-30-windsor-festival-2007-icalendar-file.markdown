<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/1275799465/" title="Windsor Castle from the Rugby Field"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1402/1275799465_1e8c687e27_m.jpg" title="Windsor Castle" alt="Windsor Castle" align="right" border="0" height="180" width="240" /></a>The <a href="http://www.windsorfestival.com/" title="Windsor Festival Website">Windsor Festival 2007</a> is nearly upon us. This annual festival has apparently been <a href="http://www.windsorfestival.com/about/history_fest.shtml" title="Windsor Festival History">running since 1969</a> and usually involves a wide variety of events for two weeks at the end of September.

Since I'm actually working in Windsor this year I'm interested in what's going on and may attend some of the events. To this end I wanted the events in my calender. So I scurried along to <a href="http://www.windsorfestival.com/cgi-bin/winds/performances/view.pl?action=index" title="Events at the Windsor Festival in 2007">the events page on the festival website</a> fully expecting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" title="The iCalendar Format">iCalendar</a> file to be waiting for me, but it seems that the developers of the website (a company called <a href="http://www.bright-interactive.com/" title="Bright Interactive did the web design and development for the Windsor Festival web site">Bright Interactive</a>) neglected to include one.

So I made one, and I now share it with the world for the greater good. This file can be imported into any application that supports the iCalendar format.

The content of that file was copied from the events page on the festival website. If you find any errors in it please let me know. I will try to keep it updated should the events change but I can't guarantee it. Again, please let me know if you spot that something has changed.
