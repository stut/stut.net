Over the weekend I wrote a script to post <a title="Freeads Classifieds in the UK" href="http://uk.freeads.net/">new ads from Freeads Classifieds</a> on <a title="Everyone's a Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. For me this was primarily a technology experiment but it may prove useful to someone so I thought I'd let everyone know about it.
