Not having much luck with the blog these days.

Easily took over 3 weeks to change the nameservers on the domain record for stut.net. In the meantime the servers that were running the old nameservers were taken offline. The result... stut.net dropped off the net, both webwise and email.

I'm not happy and will be going through the evil manual process of moving stut.net to <a href="http://gandi.net/" title="Gandi - domain registration and hosting">Gandi</a> where most of my other domains live. This is something I've been avoiding for a while. Why it's still an offline process is beyond me, but if that's what I need to do to get away from an incompetent company then so be it.

If you've tried to email me during the past 2 weeks chances are I didn't get it, so if you haven't had a response please send it again. Thanks.

Really not happy!
