Ok, so this site is becoming one of those with an identity crisis! I really do intend to stick to this design for a while. The backend has been replaced with my latest PHP framework which is simple, fast and flexible - more on that in the coming weeks. For now just enjoy the new design, and please leave your thoughts in the comment section.

The RSS feed should still work, but the URL has changed. The old URL is redirected but please update your aggregators and bookmarks as soon as possible.

Please also take a look at my <a hef="http://sjdphotography.com/">Photography Portfolio</a> which I put live a few weeks ago. It's my pick of the images I've captured and will be updated as time moves forward.

I know a few of the links on this new site don't work - mainly in the code section. I'll be fixing these as I create more content for the site.
