Based on the following video it would appear that the police have finally gotten around to understanding the law. The same cannot be said for private security personnel!

<blockquote>On Tuesday 21 June 2011 six photographers were assigned different areas of the City to photograph. Some used tripods, some went hand held, one set up a 5 x 4.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All were instructed to keep to public land and photograph the area as they would on a normal day. The event aimed to test the policing of public and private space by private security firms and their reaction to photographers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All six photographers were stopped on at least one occasion. Three encounters led to police action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is what happened.</blockquote>
