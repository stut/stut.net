Something I've been wanting to get for a while is a proper flash gun. The main reason I've been putting it off is the cost. A semi-decent one will set you back £150, and the one I really wanted was over £300! However, with my sisters wedding coming up, and the rest of life generally going well I decided now was the time. So I ordered a <a href="http://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/58647/art/canon/speedlite-580ex-flash.html" title="Good value with excellent customer service">Canon Speedlite 580EX from PixMania</a> for just over £330 - a price I was more than happy to pay now I've seen what it can do. Ok, so maybe my sisters wedding is a bit of an excuse, and this may just be a new toy that I really really wanted, but so far I've been very impressed with its performance.

A while back I posted some photo's from my <a href="http://stut.net/blog/2007/01/22/extension-tubes/" title="Hosted in a Google Picasa Web Album">first experiments with an extension tube set</a>. One of the things that annoyed me about that session was the difficulties involved in setting up the lighting using desk lamps. I think I managed to get some very good shots during that session, but I took a lot more than the few that I posted, and most were rejected due to the lighting. With a professional flash in hand, and a few items I had lying around my desk I had another go, and I have to say <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/sets/72157600170023320/" title="First experiments with a Canon Speedlite 580EX flash">the results were fantastic</a>.
