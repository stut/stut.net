Tony Blair goes to a primary school to talk about the war. After his talk he invites questions. One little boy puts up his hand, and the Prime Minister asks him his name. "Billy!"

"And what is your question, Billy?"

"I have three questions," says the  boy. "First - why did we invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Second - why are you Prime Minister when the whole country knows you are a liar and a cheat? And  third - whatever happened to Osama bin Laden?"

Just then the bell rings for playtime. Tony informs the children that they will continue after recess. When they resume, the Prime minister says: "Okay where were we? Oh that's right, question time. Who has a question?"

A different little boy puts his hand, Tony points him out and asks his name. "Steve!"

"And what is your question, Steve?"

"I have five questions: First - why did the USA invade Iraq without the support of the UN? Second - why are you Prime Minister when the whole country knows you are a liar and a cheat? Third - whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? Fourth - why did the playtime bell go 20 minutes early? And fifth - what happened to Billy?
