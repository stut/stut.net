It's been a while since I used <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a> for various uninteresting reasons, but someone pointed out to me today that they have a <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/policy">usage policy</a>. The fact that they have one is not really the most interesting part - what it says made me smile.
<blockquote>The tracker may not be used by anyone with the intention to track usage, log ip addresses/usage or anything else that we consider intrusion of privacy or disruption of tracker service.</blockquote>
So basically, if any company (MPAA, RIAA, whoever) uses their tracker to gather information later used to bring criminal charges against users, TPB may be able to help those users out by enforcing their rights according to their usage policy.
<blockquote>We reserve the rights to charge for usage of the tracker in case this policy is violated. The charge will consist of a basic fee of EUR 5 000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation.</blockquote>
I know people who've received notifications from their ISP's regarding Copyright violations, and they assure me they've only ever used TPB. I wonder what would happen if they supplied TPB with enough information to prove the organisations involved have violated this policy. Do you think TPB have this in place to assist in fighting these companies when they "take action"?
