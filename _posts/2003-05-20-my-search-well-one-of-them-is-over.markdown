 After years of looking I have found the ultimate database management tool. <a href="http://stut.net/blog/wp-admin/%5C%22http://www.aquafold.com/%5C%22" target="\"_blank\"">Aqua Data Studio</a> is multi-platform, multi-dbms and most importantly <strong>free</strong> for personal use.

Now to end another of my searches and get a job :-(
