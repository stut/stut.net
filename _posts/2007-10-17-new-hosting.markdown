If you're seeing this post then you're seeing a site served by <a href="http://www.flexiscale.com/" title="Utility Computing On-Demand">Flexiscale</a>, a new hosting platform from <a href="http://www.xcalibre.co.uk/" title="UK-based web hosting">Xcalibre</a>. When I've been using it for a little while I'll be able to say more about it, but for now it's enough to say that moving the blog and <a href="http://stut.net/" title="Stut.net - The personal homepage of Stuart Dallas">stut.net</a> was painless, performance is reasonable and I'm looking forward to seeing what this platform is capable of.
