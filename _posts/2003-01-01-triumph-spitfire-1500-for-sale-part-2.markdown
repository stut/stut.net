<a href="/gallery/11/1"><img src="/galleryimages/Spitfire1500/June2002/thumbs/sPICT0001.jpg" align="right" border="0" /></a>Ok, I've got myself organised now. You can see pictures of my Spitfire <a href="/gallery/11">here</a> and <a href="/gallery/26">here</a>. As I've said before, it's a red 1978 Triumph Spitfire 1500 with overdrive. I have a spare hood, a hard top and various other spares. It's great fun to drive and I'm sorry to see it go, but unfortunately it has to. The car was valued by the <a href="http://www.tssc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Triumph Sports Six Club</a> at £2,000 prior to £1200's worth of work being done, so I am looking for £2,250 ono.
