<p>Browsing around randomly this morning I came across a few video's on <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> that I thought were worth sharing, so here they are.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=BkHrTC_N-sg">Rolling tires down a ski slope</a>. Be sure to watch to the end, the last one is a classic!  <li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=K2cYWfq--Nw">Daft Hands - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</a>. A slow starter, but it's worth sticking with&nbsp;it.  <li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NWsX6DfEtIM">Creature Comforts (US)</a>. An American version of the most excellent <a href="http://www.creaturecomforts.tv/">Creature Comforts</a> series from here in the UK.  <li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=kaOEmDJUNmM">Kids playing on the railway tracks</a>. Dangerous? Probably. Most excellent? Definitely.  <li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=27gG7xaLTqY">Spontaneous Snail</a>. The invention snails everywhere have been waiting for. <li><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">Evolution of Dance</a>. If you haven't seen this yet, what planet have you been living on? Well-worth 6 minutes of your life!</li></ul> <p>Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.</p>
