<a href="http://blog.assembleron.com/" title="The Programming and Management Blog">Nick Halstead</a> has invited me to be a judge for a <a href="http://blog.assembleron.com/2007/06/14/php-programming-contest-win-zend-studio/" title="PHP Competition - Win Zend Studio">PHP competition</a> he's running on his blog. <a href="http://www.zend.com/" title="Zend">Zend</a> have donated some prizes for it, including a copy of <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_studio?hpb=4" title="PHP Development IDE from Zend">Zend Studio Professional</a>, so it's definitely worth entering.

The problem is based on a TV quiz show involving moving from one word to another by changing a single letter at a time. Each intermediate word must exist in a user-supplied dictionary. For full details head on over to <a href="http://blog.assembleron.com/2007/06/14/php-programming-contest-win-zend-studio/" title="PHP Competition - Win Zend Studio">the competition page on Nick's blog</a>.

I'm looking forward to seeing the solutions that come in. I'm constantly amazed by the variety of solutions different people arrive at for the same problem. Should be a lot of fun.
