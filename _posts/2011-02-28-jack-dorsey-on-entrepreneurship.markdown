This is a fantastic talk Jack Dorsey gave recently at Stanford University. He talks about how he got started in software, where Twitter came from and provides an insight into where both Twitter and Square are going.

Among other gems he <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2646" title="Expect the unexpected and whenever possible, be the unexpected">mentions a quote</a> that I absolutely love.

<blockquote>
	Expect the unexpected and whenever possible, be the unexpected.
</blockquote>

I strongly suggest that anyone in the business of business watches the whole talk!
