<div style="float:right;background-color:black;color:white;padding:4px;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:0.25em;text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7913872@N03/2965700582" title="View 'Southsea beach' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2965700582_98ae38ca47_m.jpg" alt="Southsea beach" border="0" width="240" height="160" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:10px;">Pebble Beach, Southsea, Oct 2008</span></div>
A couple of months back I got an email request via my Flickr account from <a href="http://www.schmap.com/">Schmap.com</a> asking if they could include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/2965700582/">one of my photo's</a> in their next update. I rarely say no when politely asked for permission so I happily followed the link and approved it.

I just got a follow-up email from them saying the update had gone live and did indeed include that photo. However, it's just wrong, so very very wrong.

The photo is of the beach at Southsea taken from the pier. It's a pebble beach. It's tagged with both "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/tags/southsea/">southsea</a>" and "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/tags/pebblebeach/">pebble beach</a>" and the title is "<a href="<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartdallas/2965700582/">Southsea beach</a>".

The article they've put this photo on is about ... you guessed it, Pebble Beach, Monterey and Carmel. All I can assume is that no actual person has reviewed it before being published. I just hope the photo doesn't put people off visiting Pebble Beach - I can assure you it's nothing like Southsea.

I've taken a screenshot of the page because I fully expect them to remove it if they ever see this post. Gotta love lazy editors!
