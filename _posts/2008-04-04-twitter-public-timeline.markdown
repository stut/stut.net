Last night I finally got access to the full public feed from <a href="http://twitter.com/stut" title="Stuart Dallas on Twitter">Twitter</a>. I've written a daemon in C to push all tweets received into a DB and knocked up a little toy to test that it's working.
<p align="center"><strong><a href="http://random.twitapps.com/" title="Display a random tweet from the Twitter public timeline">Random Tweet</a></strong></p>
Doesn't do much, just displays a random tweet from the past hour. Probably not useful to anyone besides me but I've found it quite interesting to see the random crap people tweet about, maybe you will too.

Next step is to feed this data into <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/" title="Tweetmeme - letting you know what's popular on Twitter">Tweetmeme</a> and a couple of other ideas I've got, but need to make sure this is 110% stable first.
