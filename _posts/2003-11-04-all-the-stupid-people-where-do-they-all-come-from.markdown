There is an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/33737.html" target="_blank">excellent opinion piece</a> by Tim Mullen over at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/" target="_blank">ElReg</a> on the situation Microsoft currently finds itself in regarding security. I fully agree with what Tim is saying. The problem is not so much that MS software is full of bugs (we've known that for a while). The problem is the way their software is implemented by customers.

Read the article then ask yourself if any daft IT policies are in place where you work. And remember that not everything that comes down from 'the board' is gospel. In my experience, especially where IT is concerned, it's complete and utter bollocks. But that could just be the companies I've previously worked for.
