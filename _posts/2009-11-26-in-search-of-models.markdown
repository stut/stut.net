I'm looking to develop my portrait photography skills so I'm throwing this out there to see if anyone's interested in a free photo session. I take a lot of photos but aside from weddings I generally haven't had a lot of experience taking pictures of people. I want to change that.

<!--more-->So here's the deal. I'm offering to do on-location photo shoots with you and anyone else you want to involve; just you, you and your partner, you and your friends, whatever. This will give me further experience of taking portraits and add to my portfolio. As such I will require that everyone involved signs a model release.
<div style="float: right; line-height: 0.7em; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0.25em 0.5em; border: 2px solid #000;"><a style="margin: 0; padding: 0;" title="View 'Jared with a very big lens' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7913872@N03/3004433984"><img style="padding: 0; margin: 2px; border: 1px solid #000;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/3004433984_d23c4661be_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Jared with a very big lens" width="160" height="240" /></a></div>
In return you'll get a CD containing full size image files of the best shots from the shoot and you're welcome to do anything non-commercial with them. If you want to use them commercially you'll need to get my permission, but I don't see that ever being a problem. I'm also more than happy to get them professionally printed and optionally mounted.

I'm based in Surrey but would be willing to travel a reasonable distance - at the moment I don't really know how far that is so let me know where you are and I'll decide whether it's too far or not ;)

The location is completely up to you, or if I know the area I'll happily recommend places. It's up to you to let me know what you want to get from it, in terms of the experience and the resulting photos. I don't have a studio or any studio equipment but I've found the best shots come from a less formal environment.

If you're interested or have any questions please don't hesitate to <a href="/who#contact">contact me</a>. If you don't ask I can't say yes!
