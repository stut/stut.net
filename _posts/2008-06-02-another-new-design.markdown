I'm loving this one. Content is king!!

Still a few bits that need sorting layout-wise (if the comment form below is the right width then I've done it!) but definitely a major improvement on <a title="Old new Stut.net design" href="http://stut.net/blog/2008/02/15/new-stutnet-design/">the old new design</a>.

I'll shortly be migrating the articles into blog posts. I don't think there's a legitimate distinction to be made, and blog posts come bundled with comment and trackback abilities which is handy.
