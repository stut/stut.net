I was sad to hear today of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4193093.stm">passing of Ivan Noble</a>. For those who don't know, Ivan worked for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a> website and wrote a regular '<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4211475.stm">Tumour Diary</a>' column documenting his journey with a brain tumour. My thoughts are with his family.
