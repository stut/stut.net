Got bored again so I redesigned stut.net. This may become a regular thing so you'll have to get used to it. Having said that I quite like this one so it may stay like this for a while. As usual there are a few glitches left even though I've activated it. As usual these will be worked out as and when they annoy me too much.

You may also notice that the "Cool Stuff" feature is back (see navigation column).

The "Archived cool stuff" link doesn't work yet - it will soon.
