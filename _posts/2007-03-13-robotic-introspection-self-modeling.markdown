This really is quite impressive. If I'm understanding it correctly they basically created this robot and told it very limited information about itself. It has an internal modeling system where it can model potential arrangements of itself. It uses that to compare to real life to figure out what it looks like.

Once it has its basic construction worked out it tries to walk. First it models it, and then it tries to do it in real life. It actually has an amount of success doing that.

Even more impressive is that when they halve the length of one of its legs, it adjusts its internal model and modifies the way its walking.

It's the beginning of the end I tells ya!
