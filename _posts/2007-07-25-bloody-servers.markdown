Well that was annoying. The server this blog (and <a href="http://stut.net/" target="_blank" title="Stut.net">stut.net</a>) is on suffered a minor (ahem) issue. Basically the filesystem got corrupted, and what with RAID being as reliable as it is it fails to protect from that problem and happily duplicated the corruption to all disks.

A short(ish) battle with my host and a hefty bill later I’m back up and running. Nothing was lost which is great but it still gave me a bit of a scare.

Unfortunately this is not the only server problem I’m having at the moment. I have a server in the US that’s showing a scary number of HDD errors in the logs almost certainly indicating that it’s about to fail. Wheels were in motion to replace that server already (it’s well over 3 years old) and I’m just hoping nothing dies until that happens.
