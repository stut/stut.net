I have now had a few people ask how my job search is going, so I thought an update was in order. I have a new job, and I've already started it.I'm working for <a href="http://www.freeads.co.uk/">Freeads.co.uk</a>, based in Windsor and so far I'm loving it.

There's lots to get done, and a few major challenges to conquer, but I don't think I'm able to give any further details at the moment.

I'm sure as time goes on and as we get things done I will be able to say more.
