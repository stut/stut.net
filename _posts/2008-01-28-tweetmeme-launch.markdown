<img src="/assets/chick.png" alt="Tweetmeme Chick" style="margin: 0pt 8px 0pt 0pt" align="left" />For the past couple of weeks I've been involved in developing a new site called <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/" title="Tweetmeme - letting you know what's popular on Twitter">Tweetmeme</a> and it launches today.

You can read all about it on the <a href="http://blog.tweetmeme.com/2008/01/28/tweetmeme-launch/" title="Tweetmeme Blog">Tweetmeme blog</a>, but in short it watches activity on <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and keeps track of popular URLs. There is a river of URLs, RSS feeds and it also posts new URLs that get promoted to the river in Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/tweetmeme" title="Tweetmeme user on Twitter">tweetmeme</a>). The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/the-killer-twitter-tracker-just-arrived-and-its-name-is-tweetmeme/" title="Techmeme launch on Techcrunch">launch has been covered</a> by <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" title="Techcrunch">Techcrunch</a>.

I've had a lot of fun developing Tweetmeme and I hope it becomes a valued resource for the Twitter community.
