Ok, this is bizarre. On my weekly review of site logs I noticed that someone had searched for "girl friday curriculum vitae" with Yahoo and come here. To find out why I went to Yahoo and did the same search. Lo and behold <a href="/">Stut.net</a> was the first result on the UK site and second on the US site. Bizarre.
