We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes;<br />
but the plural of ox became oxen not oxes.<br />
One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br />
yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br />
You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice;<br />
yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.

If the plural of man is always called men,<br />
why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?<br />
If I spoke of my foot and show you my feet,<br />
and I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br />
If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br />
why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?

Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br />
yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br />
and the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br />
We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br />
but though we say mother, we never say methren.

Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br />
but imagine the feminine, she, shis and shim.
