I love <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/" title="Dilbert - the greatest cartoon ever!">Dilbert</a>, always have. Sometime it hits a particular nail right on the head. <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20071014.html" title="Dilbert cartoon for Sunday, October 14th, 2007">Today's is a great example</a>.

Experience is gained by experiencing stuff, not by being told what it's like. You can tell a kid a thousand times that they'll hurt themselves if they fall off the wall, but they have to do it themselves to really get it and it doesn't just apply when you're young. The best lessons are learnt by falling on your head!

Now go take a walk along a wall.
