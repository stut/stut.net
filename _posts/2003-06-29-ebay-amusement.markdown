I read with great amusement that the buyer of <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2410079847" target="_blank">my Spitfire</a> has <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=29760&amp;item=2413695214" target="_blank">resold it on eBay</a> at a loss of Â£350!! I've failed to come up with a comment that doesn't make me sound evil or harsh so I've decided not to say anything at all.

PS. On the job front I've had several interviews recently and I'm waiting to hear the verdict - everything is crossed that one of them will see my potential and snap me up before it's too late ;-)
