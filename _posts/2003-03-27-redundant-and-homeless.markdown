I've been made redundant. Market conditions have caused my employer to lay off a fifth of it's workforce and I'm one of them. And since my home was provided as part of the job, that goes with it.

So, I am now looking for a new job. My CV can be found at <a href="http://stuart.cvsite.com/" target="_blank">stuart.cvsite.com</a>. If you think you may know of an opportunity please let me know as soon as possible.

I'm off to get a beer!!
